### Project Description
This chess engine simulates a full chess game, allowing users to play against each other or an AI opponent. It uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for decision-making and detects check and checkmate conditions.


### The Problem statement
Finding a robust chess engine that allows both manual gameplay and an AI opponent can be tricky, especially for beginners looking to understand how chess engines work.


### The Solution
We‚Äôve built a chess engine that simulates the game, using advanced algorithms for decision-making and AI moves, while still keeping things simple for new players. It allows you to play against an AI opponent. We tried to build an reinforcement algorithm which helps the AI improve itself but could't because of the time contraint.

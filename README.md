## Overview

The Chess Engine project is a simplified chess game engine that implements basic chess rules and advanced features like check and checkmate detection, move generation, and artificial intelligence (AI) for evaluating board positions and selecting optimal moves. The engine uses a combination of the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for decision-making, helping simulate gameplay for players and providing AI-based moves.

## Features

- **Chessboard Representation**: An 8x8 grid to represent the chessboard with pieces represented by their types and positions stored as coordinates.
- **Piece Movement**: Supports standard chess pieces, including king, queen, rook, bishop, knight, and pawn, each with its own set of valid movements and behavior.
- **Check & Checkmate Detection**: Detects when a player's king is under attack (check) and when the game reaches a checkmate condition.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Uses the minimax algorithm to explore possible moves and evaluates them based on a scoring system, considering material and positional advantages.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimizes the decision-making process by pruning unnecessary branches in the decision tree.
- **AI Opponent**: Players can make manual moves or play against the AI, which calculates the best possible move based on the board evaluation.

## Project Components

- **Board Class**: Represents the 8x8 chessboard and handles piece placement, move generation, and legality checking.
- **Piece Classes**: Each chess piece (King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, Pawn) is represented by a class that defines its movement rules and behavior.
- **AI Class**: Implements the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to determine optimal moves for the AI player.
- **Game Class**: Manages the game state, including player turns, check/checkmate detection, and move validation.

## How It Works

1. The chessboard is represented as an 8x8 grid.
2. Players take turns making moves or playing against the AI.
3. The AI uses the minimax algorithm to evaluate and select the best move.
4. The engine detects check and checkmate conditions to end the game.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the project.
3. Play the game against the AI or with another player.
4. Explore the code and enhance the engine with more features.

## Future Improvements

- Enhanced AI with better evaluation functions.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for better interaction.
- Multiplayer support to play online with friends.
